# Prescribed-time Control Examples

This repository includes some simulation examples for the prescribed-time control applied to several systems. The files are uploaded as RAR archives of MATLAB codes and Simulink models. 

## Files:

1- The 2-DOF manipulator: PTC_ex1.rar

2- An n-dimensional normal form nonlinear system: PTC_ex2.rar

3- Input/output constrained PTC for uncertain double and triple-integrator systems: PTC_ex3.rar

4- Model-free PTC for reaction wheel pendulum: PTC_ex4.rar

5- Prescribed-time state-dependent Riccati equation (PT-SDRE) controller applied to a 2nd-order system: PT-SDRE controller.rar
